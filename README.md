# svelte-kit-file-upload

Full example with a simple form, the script client-side, and the upload server-side.

This project uses the 
[adapter-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sveltejs/adapter-node), 
[busboy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/busboy) and [fs-extra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra) packages.  

There isn't a lot of CSS and form design. Not very fun but it works!
